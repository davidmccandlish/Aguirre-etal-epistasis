This repository contains the code to reproduce the analyses from:

Lyndsey Aguirre, Anat Hendelman, Samuel F. Hutton, David M. McCandlish, and Zachary B. Lippman, 
Idiosyncratic and dose-dependent epistasis drives variation in tomato fruit size

The code expects a copy of the file "Aguirre-etal-Table-S3.xlsx" in the same directory as the notebook "Aguirre-etal-epistasis.nb". Evaluating this Mathematica notebook will reproduce main text Figures 1D, 2C, and 3B as well as the p-values reported in the main text and the pages from Supplemental Table S2.
